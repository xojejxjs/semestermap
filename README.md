# WalkMyWeek

**Your week on a map.** WalkMyWeek helps Boston University students:

1. **See where your classes are** — add your schedule and every building you go to shows up on the map.
2. **Choose a dorm that fits your classes** — compare dorms by how long it actually takes to walk to the places you go every day.
3. **Avoid classes too far apart** — check whether the gap between two classes is long enough to walk across campus.

## Why

- Dorm information is scattered across the BU Housing site, Xiaohongshu, Reddit and forums. There is no single place to compare dorms side by side.
- When choosing a dorm or a class schedule, students rarely have a feel for campus distances. Is 15 minutes enough to get from CAS to FitRec? (Only just — it's about a 13-minute walk, with no room for delays.)

## Features

- **Map of BU dorms and buildings** — 19 dorm locations (including Warren's towers, Bay State Road brownstones and the Fenway Campus) and 32 academic buildings, dining halls, recreation and student-service locations, color-coded by type.
- **Dorm details** — room types, amenities, floor plans, virtual tours and a link to the official BU Housing page.
- **Dorm search** — search by official name, nickname or address (e.g. `Warren`, `StuVi`, `Myles`, `188 Bay State Road`). The selected building is outlined on the map.
- **Directions** — how long is the walk between any two places? Pick a dorm, building, one of your classes or a street address (tap **Directions** on a class to get there). Recent and popular destinations are one tap away. **📍 Use my location** starts from where you are (asked only when you tap it; a blue dot follows you while Directions is open), and **Open in Google Maps / Apple Maps** hands the walk to your phone's navigation app.
- **Walks between classes** — every back-to-back pair in your week is checked against the real walking time: 🟢 easy, 🟡 tight, 🔴 not enough time. Pick a weekday to see that day's classes in order.
- **Any address** — type a street address near BU (e.g. an off-campus apartment) and it is found on the map with OpenStreetMap Nominatim. Drag the pin if the spot is slightly off.
- **Class locations** — type a room from your schedule, like `CAS 211` or `PHO 206`, using official BU building codes.
- **My classes** — add your schedule as screenshots, the BU calendar file (.ics), PDF, Word (.docx) or text. Classes are matched by course number first, then by type (lecture, discussion…) and time; days and times are standardised (Mon, Wed, Fri · 9:05 AM – 9:55 AM). Each building on the map shows how many of your classes meet there. Locations guessed from the course number always need your confirmation.
- **Dorm ranking** — choose a building and see every dorm ranked by walking time to it.
- Works on phones as well as laptops.

## How walking times are calculated

**Between listed places** (every dorm, building and class code in `data.json`), times are **real walking routes along streets and paths**. They were precomputed once with the [openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org/) foot-walking matrix API (`tools/fetch-walk-times.js`) and saved to `walk-times.json`, so the site answers instantly and no API key is ever exposed in the browser.

**For a typed address** that isn't in the list, the tool falls back to a rough estimate and says so on the page:

1. Straight-line distance using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)
2. × 1.3 detour factor
3. ÷ 80 m per minute (about 3 mph)

A route is 🟢 if you arrive with at least 3 minutes to spare, 🟡 if you make it with 0–2 minutes to spare (arriving exactly on time counts as 🟡), and 🔴 if you would be late.

**Sanity check:** BU Housing says Peabody Hall on the Fenway Campus is "about a 15-minute walk" from main campus. The real route Peabody Hall → CAS takes **17 minutes**.

**What real routes changed:** the old straight-line estimate was usually too pessimistic along Comm Ave (real times are about 0.87× the estimate), but too optimistic where you have to go around something. CAS → FitRec dropped from 17 to 13 minutes.

**Entrances:** routing snaps each point to the nearest path, which isn't always the door people use. A few buildings (e.g. MCS and PSY on Cummington Mall) have an `entrance` coordinate in `data.json` that is used for routing only.

### Limitations

- Real routes come from OpenStreetMap data, which can be missing a path or crossing (Cummington Mall was one). They also don't account for waiting at traffic lights, stairs or elevators.
- Typed addresses still use the rough straight-line estimate.
- Each Bay State Road group uses one address to represent a whole stretch of the street, so times for those groups are about ±3 minutes.
- Building locations and outlines come from OpenStreetMap and may be slightly off.

## Tech

- HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript — no framework, no build step
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for the map, with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) tiles
- `data.json` holds all dorm and building data; `shapes.json` holds building outlines

## Project structure

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Page structure: My week, dorm info and ranking, directions, map |
| `style.css` | Layout and styling, including the phone layout |
| `data.json` | Dorm and building data only — no logic |
| `shapes.json` | Building outlines, generated by `tools/fetch-shapes.js` |
| `distance.js` | Distance and walking-time calculations only |
| `geocode.js` | Turns a typed address into coordinates (OpenStreetMap Nominatim) |
| `map.js` | Everything on the map: markers, legend, route line, building outline |
| `app.js` | Main logic: load data, read user input, calculate, rank, update the page |
| `walk-times.json` | Real walking times and distances between every pair of listed places |
| `tools/fetch-walk-times.js` | One-off Node script that precomputes `walk-times.json` (needs an openrouteservice key in `.env`) |
| `tools/fetch-shapes.js` | One-off Node script that downloads building outlines from OpenStreetMap |

## Run locally

In the project folder, start a local web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000. (Opening `index.html` directly won't work, because browsers block `fetch` from reading local files.)

After adding places to `data.json` or changing coordinates, regenerate the building outlines:

```bash
node tools/fetch-shapes.js
```

## Roadmap

- Outlines for every building; student-service locations (GSU, ISSO); show/hide places by type
- Real walking routes for typed addresses too, and drawing the route along streets (with a FastAPI backend that keeps the API key private)
- Enter a weekly schedule and check every class-to-class transition automatically
- Public transit: Green Line, the 57 bus and the BU Shuttle
